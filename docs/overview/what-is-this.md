# What is JARVIS?

JARVIS is a single-machine long-short equity hedge-fund research and paper-trading system. It scores a stock universe across eight quantitative factors, layers AI-driven qualitative analysis on top, builds a market-neutral portfolio, monitors risk against hard limits, and executes orders through Alpaca paper trading.

## The problem it solves

A real long-short fund needs eight or nine integrated capabilities — universe management, price and fundamentals data, factor scoring, qualitative research, optimization, risk control, execution, attribution, and reporting. Most retail tools cover one or two. JARVIS bundles all of them into a stack that can be run end-to-end on a laptop using free data sources and a free OpenRouter model tier.

The system is for research and paper-money simulation. It is not a production trading platform.

## How it works — the mental model

Think of JARVIS as an assembly line with seven stations. Each station reads from a SQLite database, does its work, and writes back. The next station picks up where the last left off.

   prices,      factor       LLM          target     veto,        Alpaca     Streamlit
   filings,     scores,      JSON         weights    halt,        orders,    dashboard,

                             score
```

Each layer has its own entry-point script (`run_data.py`, `run_scoring.py`, etc.) that you can run independently. There is also a Streamlit dashboard (`run_dashboard.py`) and a backtesting utility (`run_backtest.py`) outside the layered flow.

## The seven layers

| Layer | Module | Entry point | What it produces |
|-------|--------|-------------|------------------|
| 1 — Data | `data/` | `run_data.py` | Universe, prices, fundamentals, SEC filings, insider data, estimates, earnings calendar in `fund.db` |
| 2 — Scoring | `factors/` | `run_scoring.py` | 8 factor scores per ticker, sector-relative composite, LONG/SHORT signal in `output/scored_universe_latest.csv` |
| 3 — AI analysis | `analysis/` | `run_analysis.py` | LLM analyzer outputs (filing, risk, insider, earnings), sector synthesis, combined score |
| 4 — Portfolio | `portfolio/` | `run_portfolio.py` | Target weights via MVO or conviction-tilt; trade list in `position_approvals` |
| 5 — Risk | `risk/` | `run_risk_check.py` | Pre-trade veto results, circuit-breaker dashboard, stress test scenarios, halt lock |
| 6 — Execution | `execution/` | `run_execution.py` | Alpaca paper-trading orders, fills, slippage statistics |
| 7 — Reporting | `reporting/`, `dashboard/` | `run_dashboard.py` | Tear sheet, P&L attribution, weekly letter, Streamlit UI |

Plus one standalone utility: `run_backtest.py` for walk-forward simulation against historical data.

## A typical end-to-end flow

The intended nightly cycle, in order:

1. **Refresh data.** `python run_data.py` pulls today's prices, fundamentals, and any new filings. Run nightly after market close.
2. **Score the universe.** `python run_scoring.py` recomputes all eight factors, ranks within each GICS sector, and labels each ticker `LONG`, `SHORT`, or `HOLD`. Output is a CSV.
3. **Run AI analysis** *(optional)*. `python run_analysis.py` uses OpenRouter to generate qualitative analyses for the top 20 longs and top 20 shorts, then computes a combined score that blends quant and AI views.
4. **Construct the portfolio.** `python run_portfolio.py --whatif` previews the rebalance. `--rebalance` queues the trades as `PENDING` for approval.
5. **Risk-check.** `python run_risk_check.py` confirms no circuit breakers are tripped and all factor exposures are within limits. Approve trades by promoting them to `APPROVED` in the database.
6. **Execute.** `python run_execution.py --execute` sends approved trades to Alpaca paper trading as limit orders.
7. **Report.** `python run_dashboard.py` opens the Streamlit UI at `http://localhost:8502` for review.

You can run any single step independently — each script reads from and writes to the same SQLite database, so state persists across runs.

## What this is NOT

- **Not a live trading system.** Execution is locked to Alpaca paper trading by default. Live mode requires an explicit environment variable that the user must set deliberately.
- **Not a backtest of a real strategy.** Backtests use *current* fundamentals and a *current* S&P 500 universe, so they have look-ahead and survivorship bias. They are directional only.
- **Not a black box.** Every factor score, every veto reason, every trade is logged to SQLite. Inspect the database directly when something is unclear.
- **Not multi-user.** State is local SQLite. There is no auth, no sharing, no cloud sync.
- **Not real-time.** The system is designed for an end-of-day rebalance cadence, not intraday signals.
